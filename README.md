# The Leipzig Glossing Rules: Conventions for interlinear morpheme-by-morpheme glosses

Leipzig, last change: May 31, 2015

Further updates will be managed by the Committee of Editors of Linguistics Journals.


## About the rules

The Leipzig Glossing Rules have been developed jointly by the Department of
Linguistics of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (Bernard
Comrie, Martin Haspelmath) and by the Department of Linguistics of the University
of Leipzig (Balthasar Bickel). They consist of ten rules for the "syntax" and
"semantics" of interlinear glosses, and an appendix with a proposed "lexicon" of
abbreviated category labels. The rules cover a large part of linguists' needs in
glossing texts, but most authors will feel the need to add (or modify) certain
conventions (especially category labels). Still, it will be useful to have a standard set
of conventions that linguists can refer to, and the Leipzig Rules are proposed as
such to the community of linguists. The Rules are intended to reflect common
usage, and only very few (mostly optional) innovations are proposed.
We intend to update the Leipzig Glossing Rules occasionally, so feedback is highly
welcome.

## The rules

(revised version of February 2008)

### Preamble

Interlinear morpheme-by-morpheme glosses give information about the meanings
and grammatical properties of individual words and parts of words. Linguists by and
large conform to certain notational conventions in glossing, and the main purpose
of this document is to make the most widely used conventions explicit.

Depending on the author's purposes and the readers' assumed background
knowledge, different degrees of detail will be chosen. The current rules therefore
allow some flexibility in various respects, and sometimes alternative options are
mentioned.

The main purpose that is assumed here is the presentation of an example in a
research paper or book. When an entire corpus is tagged, somewhat different
considerations may apply (e.g. one may want to add information about larger units
such as words or phrases; the rules here only allow for information about
morphemes).

It should also be noted that there are often multiple ways of analyzing the
morphological patterns of a language. The glossing conventions do not help
linguists in deciding between them, but merely provide standard ways of
abbreviating possible descriptions. Moreover, glossing is rarely a complete
morphological description, and it should be kept in mind that its purpose is not to
state an analysis, but to give some further possibly relevant information on the
structure of a text or an example, beyond the idiomatic translation.

A remark on the treatment of glosses in data cited from other sources: Glosses are
part of the analysis, not part of the data. When citing an example from a published
source, the gloss may be changed by the author if they prefer different terminology,
a different style or a different analysis.


### Rule 1: Word-by-word alignment

Interlinear glosses are left-aligned vertically, word by word, with the example. E.g.


> (1) Indonesian (Sneddon 1996: 237)
<pre>
Mereka  di  Jakarta  sekarang.  
They    in  Jakarta  now  
‘They are in Jakarta now.’</pre>



### Rule 2: Morpheme-by-morpheme correspondence

Segmentable morphemes are separated by hyphens, both in the example and in the
gloss. There must be exactly the same number of hyphens in the example and in the
gloss. E.g.


> (2) Lezgian (Haspelmath 1993: 207)
<pre>
Gila  abur-u-n      ferma  hamišaluǧ  güǧüna  amuq’-da-č.  
now   they-OBL-GEN  farm   forever    behind  stay-FUT-NEG  
‘Now their farm will not stay behind forever.’</pre>


Since hyphens and vertical alignment make the text look unusual, authors may
want to add another line at the beginning, containing the unmodified text, or resort
to the option described in Rule 4 (and especially 4C).
Clitic boundaries are marked by an equals sign, both in the object language and
in the gloss.


> (3) West Greenlandic (Fortescue 1984: 127)
<pre>
palasi=lu   niuirtur=lu  
priest=and  shopkeeper=and  
‘both the priest and the shopkeeper’</pre>


Epenthetic segments occurring at a morpheme boundary should be assigned to
either the preceding or the following morpheme. Which morpheme is to be chosen
may be determined by various principles that are not easy to generalize over, so no
rule will be provided for this.


### Rule 2A. (Optional)

If morphologically bound elements constitute distinct prosodic or phonological
words, a hyphen and a single space may be used together in the object language (but
not in the gloss).


> (4) Hakha Lai (Bickel and Nichols 2013)
<pre>
a-nii -láay  
3SG-laugh-FUT  
‘s/he will laugh’</pre>



### Rule 3: Grammatical category labels

Grammatical morphemes are generally rendered by abbreviated grammatical
category labels, printed in upper case letters (usually small capitals). A list of
standard abbreviations (which are widely known among linguists) is given at the
end of this document.
Deviations from these standard abbreviations may of course be necessary in
particular cases, e.g. if a category is highly frequent in a language, so that a shorter
abbreviation is more convenient, e.g. CPL (instead of COMPL) for "completive", PF
(instead of PRF) for "perfect", etc. If a category is very rare, it may be simplest not to
abbreviate its label at all.
In many cases, either a category label or a word from the metalanguage is
acceptable. Thus, both of the glosses (5a or 5b) may be chosen, depending on the
purpose of the gloss.


> (5a) Russian
<pre>
My   s    Marko  poexa-l-i  avtobus-om  v    Peredelkino.  
1PL  COM  Marko  go-PST-PL  bus-INS     ALL  Peredelkino  
‘Marko and I went to Perdelkino by bus.’</pre>



> (5b) Russian
<pre>
My  s     Marko  poexa-l-i  avtobus-om  v   Peredelkino.  
we  with  Marko  go-PST-PL  bus-by      to  Peredelkino  
‘Marko and I went to Perdelkino by bus.’</pre>



### Rule 4: One-to-many correspondences

When a single object-language element is rendered by several metalanguage
elements (words or abbreviations), these are separated by periods. E.g.


> (6) Turkish
<pre>
çık-mak  
come.out-INF  
‘to come out’</pre>



> (7) Latin
<pre>
insul-arum  
island-GEN.PL  
‘of the islands’</pre>



> (8) French
<pre>
aux        chevaux  
to.ART.PL  horse.PL  
‘to the horses’</pre>



> (9) German
<pre>
unser-n     Väter-n  
our-DAT.PL  father.PL-DAT.PL  
‘to our fathers’</pre>



> (10) Hittite (Lehmann 1982: 211)
<pre>
n=an      apedani      mehuni       essandu.  
CONN=him  that.DAT.SG  time.DAT.SG  eat.they.shall  
‘They shall celebrate him on that date.’</pre>



> (11) Jaminjung (Schultze-Berndt 2000: 92)
<pre>
nanggayan  guny-bi-yarluga?  
who        2DU.A.3SG.P-FUT-poke  
‘Who do you two want to spear?’</pre>


The ordering of the two metalanguage elements may be determined by various
principles that are not easy to generalize over, so no rule will be provided for this.
There are various reasons for a one-to-many correspondence between object-
language elements and gloss elements. These are conflated by the uniform use of
the period. If one wants to distinguish between them, one may follow Rules 4A-E.


### Rule 4A. (Optional)

If an object-language element is neither formally nor semantically segmentable and
only the metalanguage happens to lack a single-word equivalent, the underscore
may be used instead of the period.


> (12) Turkish
<pre>
çık-mak  
come_out-INF  
‘to come out’</pre>



### Rule 4B. (Optional)

If an object-language element is formally unsegmentable but has two or more
clearly distinguishable meanings or grammatical properties, the semi-colon may be
used. E.g.


> (13) Latin
<pre>
insul-arum  
island-GEN;PL  
‘of the islands’</pre>



> (14) French
<pre>
aux        chevaux  
to;ART;PL  horse;PL  
‘to the horses’</pre>



### Rule 4C. (Optional)

If an object-language element is formally and semantically segmentable, but the
author does not want to show the formal segmentation (because it is irrelevant
and/or to keep the text intact), the colon may be used. E.g.


> (15) Hittite (Lehmann 1982: 211)
<pre>
n=an      apedani      mehuni       essandu.  
CONN=him  that:DAT;SG  time:DAT;SG  eat:they:shall  
‘They shall celebrate him on that date.’</pre>



### Rule 4D. (Optional)

If a grammatical property in the object-language is signaled by a
morphophonological change (ablaut, mutation, tone alternation, etc.), the backslash
is used to separate the category label and the rest of the gloss.


> (16) German
<pre>
unser-n     Väter-n  
our-DAT.PL  father\PL-DAT.PL  
‘to our fathers’</pre>



> (17) Irish
<pre>
bhris-is  
PST\break-2SG  
‘you broke’</pre>



> (18) Kinyarwanda
<pre>
mú-kòrà  
SBJV\1PL-work  
‘that we work’</pre>



### Rule 4E. (Optional)

If a language has person-number affixes that express the agent-like and the patient-
like argument of a transitive verb simultaneously, the symbol ">" may be used in
the gloss to indicate that the first is the agent-like argument and the second is the
patient-like argument.


> (19) Jaminjung (Schultze-Berndt 2000: 92)
<pre>
nanggayan  guny-bi-yarluga?  
who        2DU>3SG-FUT-poke  
‘Who do you two want to spear?’</pre>



### Rule 5: Person and number labels

Person and number are not separated by a period when they cooccur in this order.
E.g.


> (20) Italian
<pre>
and-iamo  
go-PRS.1PL  
‘we go’</pre>



### Rule 5A. (Optional)

Number and gender markers are very frequent in some languages, especially when
combined with person. Several authors therefore use non-capitalized shortened
abbreviations without a period. If this option is adopted, then the gloss
in (21b) is used.


> (21a) Belhare
<pre>
ne-e     a-khim-chi         n-yuNNa  
DEM-LOC  1SG.POSS-house-PL  3NSG-be.NPST  
‘Here are my houses.’</pre>



> (21b) Belhare
<pre>
ne-e     a-khim-chi       n-yuNNa  
DEM-LOC  1sPOSS-house-PL  3ns-be.NPST  
‘Here are my houses.’</pre>



### Rule 6: Non-overt elements

If the morpheme-by-morpheme gloss contains an element that does not correspond
to an overt element in the example, it can be enclosed in square brackets (as in 22a). An
obvious alternative is to include an overt "∅" in the object-language text, which is
separated by a hyphen like an overt element (as in 22b).


> (22a) Latin
<pre>
puer  
boy[NOM.SG]  
‘boy’</pre>



> (22b) Latin
<pre>
puer-∅  
boy-NOM.SG  
‘boy’</pre>



### Rule 7: Inherent categories

Inherent, non-overt categories such as gender may be indicated in the gloss, but a
special boundary symbol, the round parenthesis, is used. E.g.


> (23) Hunzib (van den Berg 1995: 46)
<pre>
ož-di-g     xõxe      m-uq'e-r  
boy-OBL-AD  tree(G4)  G4-bend-PRET  
‘Because of the boy the tree bent.’</pre>



### Rule 8: Bipartite elements

Grammatical or lexical elements that consist of two parts which are treated as
distinct morphological entities (e.g. bipartite stems such as Lakhota na-xʔu̧ 'hear')
may be treated in two different ways:

(i) The gloss may simply be repeated:


> (24) Lakhota
<pre>
na-wíčha-wa-xʔu̧  
hear-3PL.UND-1SG.ACT-hear  
‘I hear them’</pre>


(ii) One of the two parts may be represented by a special label such as STEM:


> (25) Lakhota
<pre>
na-wíčha-wa-xʔu̧  
hear-3PL.UND-1SG.ACT- STEM  
‘I hear them’</pre>


Circumfixes are "bipartite affixes" and can be treated in the same way, e.g.


> (26a) German
<pre>
ge-seh-en  
PTCP-see-PTCP  
‘seen’</pre>



> (26b) German
<pre>
ge-seh-en  
PTCP-see-CIRC  
‘seen’</pre>



### Rule 9: Infixes

Infixes are enclosed by angle brackets, and so is the object-language counterpart in
the gloss.


> (27) Tagalog
<pre>
b<um>ili  
<ACTFOC>buy  
‘buy’</pre>



> (28) Latin
<pre>
reli<n>qu-ere  
leave<PRS>-INF  
‘to leave’</pre>


Infixes are generally easily identifiable as left-peripheral (as in 27) or as right-
peripheral (as in 28), and this determines the position of the gloss corresponding to
the infix with respect to the gloss of the stem. If the infix is not clearly peripheral,
some other basis for linearizing the gloss has to be found.


### Rule 10: Reduplication

Reduplication is treated similarly to affixation, but with a tilde (instead of an
ordinary hyphen) connecting the copied element to the stem.


> (29) Hebrew
<pre>
yerak~rak-im  
green~ATT-M.PL  
‘greenish ones’</pre>



> (30) Tagalog
<pre>
bi~bili  
IPFV~buy  
‘is buying’</pre>



> (31) Tagalog
<pre>
b<um>i~bili  
<ACTFOC>IPFV~buy  
‘is buying’</pre>
